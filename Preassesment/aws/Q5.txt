In the left navigation pane, choose Subnets.

Choose Create Subnet.

For Name tag, enter a name for your subnet, such as Private subnet.

For VPC, choose the VPC that you created earlier.

For Availability Zone, choose a different Availability Zone than your original subnets in the VPC.

For IPv4 CIDR block, enter a valid CIDR block. For example, the wizard creates CIDR blocks in 10.0.0.0/24 and 10.0.1.0/24 by default. You could use 10.0.3.0/24 for your second private subnet.
